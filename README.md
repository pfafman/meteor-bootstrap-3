Bootstrap 3.3.1
===============

[Bootstrap 3.3.1](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) packaged for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) 1.0 (no optional theme included)

Packaged by [Tim Pfafman](https://github.com/pfafman/meteor-bootstrap-3)


### Installation

```
meteor add pfafman:bootstrap-3
```

#### Why another package of this?

I needed boostrap 3 on meteor 1.0 and I could not find an existing package of this that was not working.  Also looks like a fair amount of thinking to get the [less version](https://github.com/simison/bootstrap3-less/) of this to work!
